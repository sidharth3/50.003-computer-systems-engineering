### Lab 1
* Lab assignment that teaches the basics of process management, ie; forking, spawning, terminating and dispatching custom processes in C.  
* Shows how to use shared memory among processes and protecting shared resources using semaphores.
To run the program, go to dir ```../ProcessManagement_Lab/``` then enter ```./out```

### Lab 2
* Lab that highlights the implementation of [Banker's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm), given 'n' customers and 'm' resources, the algorithm checks whether the requests made by the customers can be fulfilled by the resources and prevents the system from going into a deadlock state.
* To run the program, go to ```../Java/```, then enter ```make``` to compile the code. Then enter  ```java TestBankQ1 q1_1.txt ```

### Programming Assignment 1
* Follows the implementation of a bash shell using C.
* To run the shell, first go to  ```../ProgrammingAssignment1/ ```, then enter  ```make``` to compile the code. Then enter  ```./customshell```. To exit the shell, enter  ```exit```.
